/**
 * \ingroup gui
 * Abstract base class that may be implemented to handle new types of data to be dropped in QGIS.
 *
 * Implementations have three approaches they can use to handle drops.
 *
 * 1. The simplest approach is to implement handeFileDrop() when they need to handle
 * dropped files (i.e. with mime type "text/uri-list").
 *
 * 2. Reimplement handleCustomUriDrop() when they want to handle dropped custom
 * QgsMimeDataUtils::Uri entries, for instance handling dropping custom entries
 * from the browser tree (with mime type "application/x-vnd.qgis.qgis.uri"). In
 * this case the implementation's customUriProviderKey() must match the uri
 * entry's providerKey.
 *
 * 3. Reimplement handleMimeData() to directly handle dropped QMimeData.
 * Subclasses should take care when overriding this method. When a drop event
 * occurs, Qt will lock the source application of the drag for the duration
 * of the drop event handling via handleMimeData() (e.g. dragging files from
 * explorer to QGIS will lock the explorer window until the drop handling has
 * been complete). Accordingly handleMimeData() implementations must return
 * quickly and defer any intensive or slow processing.
 *
 * \since QGIS 3.0
